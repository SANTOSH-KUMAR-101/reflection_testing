Problem Statement 1:-

    Consider the Following API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos. 
    The API returns data representing a list of to-do items. 
    (a) Create an Ajax request to this API and 
    (b) Use the response to create an HTML list of the title and completed status of each of the to-do items.  


Problem Statement 2:- 

    Consider the Code Below:  
    setTimeout( ()=>{console.log("Time1")}, 3000)
    setTimeout( ()=>{console.log("Time2")}, 2000)
    setTimeout( ()=>{console.log("Time3")}, 1000)

      Output of the above code is 
      Time 3
      Time 2
      Time 1

      Without updating the timings change the code using asynchronous methodlogies such that it prints the following output,
      Time 1
      Time 2
      Time 3

 
Problem Statement 3:-

    Write a test for a function that accepts an array and return all the even numbers in that array.

Problem Statement 4:-

    Create a function tjat accepts an array called 'myarray' as an argument, iterates through 'myarray', 
    and returns a new array which contains all the even number in 'myarray'.
    Sample input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
    Sample output: [2,4,6,8]
      
 Problem Statement 5:-
